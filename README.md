cluster
=======

Simple python command line utility that clusters text.

Too many files in /tmp to get a good overview of whats in there? Want to
separate images from your phone from those taken by your digital camera?
Cluster the files by name!

    $ ls | ./cluster.py

To cluster contents of a file do:

    $ ./cluster.py file.txt
